# Dashcam automatic power bank back up

Dash cameras are great devices that can assist your claim when a road incident happens. Most often incidents that are difficult to attribute to a responsible party are damage sustained to your vehicle while parked. The problem is, dash camera normal power source (the 12V power outlets) stops delivering power when the engine is turned off to avoid discharging the vehicle battery completely. The built in dash camera batteries are very low capacity and usually cannot operate for more than 5 minutes after the engine is turned off.

The common solution to this problem is to wire the dash camera directly to the vehicle battery through the fuse box. However, this runs the risk of discharging the car battery completely if the car is parked for a prolonged period while recording. I am aware that some dashcam manufacturers make voltage monitors that cut off power to the dashcam when the vehicle battery voltage drops below a certain threshold. I feel that these devices are quite expensive for the functionality they provide (normally circa $200).

Instead, I wanted to connect the dash camera to a portable battery (power bank) and have the power source switch from the car to the power bank when the engine is turned off and vice versa. Initially, I was hoping that if I put a power bank between the vehicle USB power (5V) output and the dashcam, the power bank would deliver power to the dashcam and charge while the vehicle is running and then keep delivering power to the dashcam when the car is turned off.
